# Homework! 

[TryHackMe Link to be given by Mr K] 

Cookie Monster needs you to steal cookies! The homework is a simple CTF for the most part but there are some questions. 

## Task 1: Managing Cookies  
Create an account. I heard they gave free cookies. 

> Hint: Inspect the 'flag' cookie.

## Task 2: What type of Cookie is that?  
From the cookies that you saw from task #1, what type of cookie is the 'user' cookie? 

> Hint: Stateless or Stateful?

## Task 3: Hijacking Time! 
It seems that 'Elmo' is a frequent user of this site. I wonder what his cookies taste like? Steal his session cookie and log in for me, there's a tasty flag for it. 

> Hint: Based on previous homeworks, what kind of attack can we do to this website? What does it seem to be vulnerable to, especially when looking on the dashboard?
